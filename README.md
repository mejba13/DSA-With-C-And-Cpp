# DSA-With-C-And-Cpp

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of data structures and algorithms (DSA) implemented using **C** and **C++**. The goal of this project is to provide well-structured solutions to common algorithmic challenges and help improve problem-solving skills.

## Features:
- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Trees
- Graphs
- Sorting and Searching Algorithms
- Dynamic Programming
- Recursion
- and more...

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DSA-With-C-And-Cpp.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory and compile the C/C++ code:
   ```bash
   cd DSA-With-C-And-Cpp
   g++ filename.cpp -o output
   ./output
   ```

## Structure
Each folder represents a category of problems. Each file contains an implementation of a specific data structure or algorithm with a brief description.
